The code has a bug. The error is a NameError("name 'sys' is not defined"). This error occurs because the 'sys' module is not imported. 

The corrected code is:

```
import sys
import heapq

def dijkstra(graph, start):
    distances = {node: sys.maxsize for node in graph}
    distances[start] = 0
    pq = [(0, start)]

    while pq:
        current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(pq)

        if current_distance > distances[current_node]:
            continue

        for neighbor, weight in graph[current_node].items():
            distance = current_distance + weight

            if distance < distances[neighbor]:
                distances[neighbor] = distance
                heapq.heappush(pq, (distance, neighbor))

    return distances

graph = {
    'A': {'B': 1, 'C': 4},
    'B': {'A': 1, 'C': 2, 'D': 5},
    'C': {'A': 4, 'B': 2, 'D': 1},
    'D': {'B': 5, 'C': 1}
}

start_node = 'A'
result = dijkstra(graph, start_node)
print(f"Shortest distances from {start_node}: {result}")
```

This code should run without errors and produce the correct output.
